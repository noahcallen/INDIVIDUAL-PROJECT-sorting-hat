# What is this Website?
Sorting hat is a site that allows the user to use basic create, expel, and sort functions with arrays/objects. The user is able to create a new student (adding a name & photo). They can then 'sort' the student into the array all while getting a random Hogwart's house assigned to the new student. The user is also able to sort/filter based on the house that is assigned. Finally, the user is able to expel a student. This moves a student to the expelled array (Voldemort's army) making them apart of the dark army!

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a Harry Potter fan!
- The user can add their friends/family to see what Hogwart's house they would be.
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to get their friends involved and excited about being in random groups. The students have felt that the groups have not been so random and based on favorites.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new student is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of students that then prints to the DOM.
- House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
- Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
- Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.

## Code Snippet <!-- OPTIONAL, but doesn't hurt -->
const form = document.querySelector('form');

const createStudent = (taco) => {
  taco.preventDefault();
  const newStudentObj = {
    id: students.length + 1,
    name: document.querySelector('#student-name').value,
    imageURL: document.querySelector('#student-img').value,
    house: randomHouse(),
  }
  students.push(newStudentObj);
  cardsOnDom(students, '#app');
  form.reset();
};
//listen for the sort button click 
form.addEventListener('submit', createStudent);
